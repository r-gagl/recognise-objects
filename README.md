How computers learn to recognise objects
Gaming and entertainment: In a first person shooter game the computer must recognise a target to kill as well as weapons to pick up to build an inventory. However if the computer has low fps then it may result in lag and computer recognition is useless.
Transport and navigation: The automation of transport systems in cars makes computer recognition crucial to avoid accidents. the computer must recognise pedestrians, cars and in general all objects as to not crash into them, through it can't be fully reliable.
Medicine and healthcare: Computer recognition could be incredibly useful in finding the location of harmful cells such as cancer cells
